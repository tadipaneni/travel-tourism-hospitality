White Box Testing

White Box Testing is software testing technique in which internal structure, design and coding
of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to improve design, usability and
security. In white box testing, code is visible to testers so it is also called Clear box testing, Open
box testing, Transparent box testing, Code-based testing and Glass box testing.

It is one of two parts of the Box Testing approach to software testing. Its counterpart, Blackbox
testing, involves testing from an external or end-user type perspective. On the other hand,
Whitebox testing is based on the inner workings of an application and revolves around internal
testing.
